# Spectralyze GUI
A GUI utility for viewing and processing spectral data. Currently, works with
1D spectra from Keck Deimos, but has been written to easily be extended to
other types of spectra.

## Installing

Since this project is very early in its development, it is recommended you
install with pip in development mode:

```
git pull https://github.com/PatrickRWells/Spectralyze.git
cd spectralyze
pip install -e .
```

This way updating the code will be as easy as pulling the new version from
GitHub
